[Inject] public var abstractEvent:Event;
[Inject] public var concreteEvent:SomeEvent;

h3. v1.4.0

*ViewMap & MediatorMap*
contextView stage listener optimizations.

*MediatorMap*
Added IMediatorMap#hasMapping(viewClassOrName:*):Boolean;

h3. v1.3.0

*ApplicationDomain*
Added applicationDomain getter/setter to IInjector to help with Application Domains.

h3. v1.2.0

*MediatorMap.mapView*
The injectViewAs parameter is changed from expecting a Class to expecting a Class or an Array of Classes.

h3. v1.1.2

*ASDocs*
Build script updated to bundle ASDocs into SWC for inline display in Flash Builder 4. Build needs to be run against Flex SDK 4.x

h3. v1.1.1

*Mediator*
Fixed: http://github.com/robotlegs/robotlegs-framework/issues/#issue/6

h3. v1.1.0

*SwiftSuspenders*
Updated SwiftSuspenders to v1.5.1
PLEASE NOTE: mapValue no longer injects into the value instance - the old behaviour was incorrect.

*Injector*
Added IInjector#hasMapping(clazz:Class, named:String = ""):Boolean;
Added IInjector#getInstance(clazz:Class, named:String = ""):*;
Added IInjector#createChild():IInjector;

*CommandMap*
Added ICommandMap#execute(commandClass:Class, payload:Object = null, payloadClass:Class = null, named:String = ''):void
Added ICommandMap#unmapEvents() - unmaps all event mappings
Added ICommandMap#detain() and release() - enables Async Commands

*Mediator*
Added mvcs.Mediator EventMap Sugar: addViewListener() and addContextListener()

*Misc*
mvcs.Context: CommandMap and MediatorMap are handed child injectors - to enable non-destructive temporary mappings.
Deprecated IContextProvider

Removed ICommand

*MediatorMap*
Merged MediatorMap#mapModule into MediatorMap#mapView
New view mapping signature
mapView(viewClassOrName:*, mediatorClass:Class, injectViewAs:Class = null, autoCreate:Boolean = true, autoRemove:Boolean = true):void

*Actor*
Unified Model and Service into Actor
Removed Model
Removed Service

*EventMap*
Added strong event mapping to EventMap

*CommandMap*
Re-ordered the mapping arguments
From: mapEvent(commandClass:Class, eventType:String, eventClass:Class = null, oneshot:Boolean = false):void
To: mapEvent(eventType:String, commandClass:Class, eventClass:Class = null, oneshot:Boolean = false):void

h3. v0.9.5 - BigMistake2

CommandMap now accepts optional Event class parameter for stronger mapping.
The argument order had to be re-arranged so that the optional eventClass would come after the mandatory commandClass.

From: mapEvent(type:String, commandClass:Class, oneshot:Boolean = false):void;
To: mapEvent(commandClass:Class, eventType:String, eventClass:Class = null, oneshot:Boolean = false):void;
